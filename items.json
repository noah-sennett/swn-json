A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects."

Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and active again.

Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target."

The more time between injury and application, the less chance the patch has to work. Each round after the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds.
