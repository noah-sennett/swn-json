  "expert":{

    "description":"Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians, or any other concept that focuses on expertise in a non-combat skill should pick the Expert class. Experts are the best at such skills and gain more of them than other classes do.<br><br>    Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack for succeeding at the moments of greatest importance. Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new result if it’s better. This benefit can be applied to any skill check, even those that the Expert isn’t specially focused in. Their natural talent bleeds over into everything they do.<br><br>    In their chosen field, however, the Expert is exceptionally gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all PCs get at the start of the game, an Expert can choose an additional level in a non-combat focus related to their background. They can spend both of these levels on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game with level 2 in that particular knack.",
    "abilities":["You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take Specialist in their main skill, though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or some other focus might suit better. You may not take a combat-oriented focus with this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM decides whether or not a focus is permitted.","Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new roll if it’s better.","When you advance an experience level, you gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any non-combat, non-psychic skill.

  "psychic":{
    "name":"Psychic",
    "description":"Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, and can wield the psychic powers that come from that strange affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities is an extremely demanding process but allows for feats wholly impossible to ordinary men and women.<br><br>    Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Averages vary with worlds, but most range from one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who have the MES condition that make them amenable to psychic training. Some of these go their entire lives without realizing their capabilities. Others end up exploiting their native abilities without training, almost inevitably ending up seriously brain-damaged or crazed by the effects of unmediated metadimensional energy.<br><br>    Your hero has been fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other training institution capable of molding and directing these abilities. They may have come to this later in life, or been recruited young by a society that carefully watches for MES symptoms.<br><br>   Some societies deal with their psychics more generously than others. On some worlds, psychic powers are accepted and their possessors can look forward to lucrative and respected employment. On others, fear of these uncanny powers and memories of the horrors of the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.",

You can pick the same one twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free level-1 technique from that discipline.","You have an Effort score, which can be used to fuel psychic abilities.

    "description":"Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder, gengineered combat hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero has a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in Stars Without Number is extremely dangerous, but your hero has the talents to survive situations that would kill a less martial adventurer.<br><br>    As a gifted purveyor of violence, you get to pick an extra combat-related focus associated with your special brand of havoc. While a character of any class can take these special combat talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus than heroes of other classes.<br><br>    Most importantly, however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a shot when a hit is desperately needed, or dodging a bullet when their life is on the line. Once per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received, taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one of their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit. This versatility makes Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and significantly more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.",
